    MAVEN
========================================================

IQ] diff b/w install and deploy?

mvn install→ Builds and installs the artifact in the **local repository (`~/.m2/repository`)** for local use.  
mvn deploy → Uploads the artifact to a **remote repository (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory)** for team or production use.  

Use install -> when testing locally.  
Use deploy -> when sharing with others.

IQ] can we use more than one goal name along with mvn command?
ANS: Yes
EX:  mvn clean package [first it will execute clean and then package]

IQ] How to skip the unit test cases?

EX: mvn clean package -DskipTests
    mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true

IQ] where the maven default home dir?

  cd ~/.m2/repository/

  ls -lrth ---> you will see the dependecies.

IQ] How to change the maven default dir?

   step 1: cd ~ ---> goto home dir
   step 2: create one custom dir --->   mkdir mavenlocalrepo
   step 3:  /root/customMavenRepo/  -----> copy this path
   step 4: <localRepository>/root/customMavenRepo</localRepository>  ---> add this into /conf/settings.xml  

   step 5: cd /opt/apache-maven-3.9.8/conf/
   step 6: open the settings.xml

SONAR
======================================================

what is the diff between code review and code coverage?
=========================================================

code coverage:
--------------

Number of lines tested through unit test cases called as code coverage.

In any project 80% need to satisfy.

Benefits: Helps identify untested areas of code

Tools: Tools like JaCoCo (for Java)

code review:
------------

Code review is the process of manually reviewing code by team members to find bugs, ensure to following  coding standards, and improve overall code quality.

Benefits: It Leads to better software quality, fewer bugs, and promotes best practices within the development team.

Tools: Code review tools include GitHub Pull Requests.

Quality Profile
---------------
-> Collection of rules , those can be applied during the sonarqube generation.
-> For each language one quality profile will be there

quality gates
--------------
--> set of conditions

--> By default one quality gate is avaiable, i.e Sonar way
